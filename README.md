# AI-based Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code and resources related to the development of machine learning models for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 
- Tensorflow   ```pip install tensorflow```
- Keras        ```pip install keras```
- Seaborn      ```pip install seaborn```
- Scikit-learn ```pip install scikit-learn```
- Scikit-image ```pip install scikit-image```
- Tqdm         ```pip install tqdm```





## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, which contains MRI images from multiple sites across the US and Canada. The dataset includes images from both Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls.

## Code
The code in this repository includes data preprocessing, image augmentation, model creation and evaluation using CNNs, and transfer learning techniques. The CNN models are implemented using the Keras API in Tensorflow. Transfer learning is performed using pre-trained CNN models such as VGG and ResNet.

## Results
The results of the experiments conducted using CNN models are presented in the form of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the models is compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for Alzheimer's detection.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for the development and evaluation of machine learning models for Alzheimer's disease detection using CNNs. The code and resources in this repository can be used as a starting point for further research and development in this area.
